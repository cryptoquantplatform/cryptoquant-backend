## ⚙️ How It Works (Technical):

### **Step 1: Request Reset**
- User enters email
- Backend checks if email exists
- Generates 6-digit random code
- Stores in `password_reset_codes` table with 15min expiry
- Sends email with code

### **Step 2: Verify & Reset**
- User enters code + new password
- Backend verifies:
  - Code exists
  - Not expired
  - Not used
- Hashes new password
- Updates `users.password_hash`
- Marks code as used

---

## 🛠️ Database Table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE password_reset_codes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## 📱 Features:

✅ **Beautiful UI** matching your platform design  
✅ **Step-by-step flow** (email → code → password)  
✅ **Real-time validation** (code format, password match)  
✅ **Resend code** option if user doesn't receive it  
✅ **Success animation** after reset  
✅ **Mobile responsive**  

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### **Problem: "Email not sent"**
**Fix:** Check your Gmail App Password in `.env` file

### **Problem: "Invalid code"**
**Fix:** Code expires in 15 minutes. Request a new one.

### **Problem: "User not found"**
**Fix:** Email must be registered in the system

### **Problem: "Resend not working"**
**Fix:** Backend must be running on port 5000
