## Testing SMS Verification

### **Trial Account Limitations:**

With a **trial** Twilio account:
- You can only send SMS to **verified phone numbers**
- To verify a number for testing:
  1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified
  2. Click **"Add a new number"**
  3. Enter the phone number you want to test with
  4. Verify it via SMS

### **To Remove Limitations:**

Upgrade to paid account (no monthly fee, just pay-per-SMS):
- Cost: ~$0.0075 per SMS (less than 1 cent!)
- Can send to ANY number worldwide

---

## Troubleshooting

### SMS not sending?

Check:
1. `.env` has correct credentials
2. Phone number format includes country code: `+1234567890`
3. For trial accounts, recipient number must be verified in Twilio

### Check Twilio Logs:

https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms

---

## Cost Estimate

- **Trial**: FREE ($15 credit = ~500 SMS)
- **Production**: ~$0.0075 per SMS
- **Monthly**: No monthly fees!

**Example:** 1000 registrations/month = ~$7.50/month

---

## Alternative: Skip SMS for Now

If you want to skip SMS verification for now:

- Phone number field will still be there (optional)
- Users can enter it, but won't need to verify
- You can add Twilio later when you're ready to go live

Just leave the Twilio settings empty in `.env` and it will work without SMS!
