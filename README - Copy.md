## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Users

1. **Open the Website**: Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Register**: Click "Register" or "Get Started" to create an account
3. **Enter Referral Code** (Optional): If you were invited by someone, enter their referral code
4. **Login**: After registration, login with your credentials
5. **Deposit**: Make your first deposit (minimum 75‚Ç¨ in crypto)
6. **Start Earning**: Click the "Click to Earn" button to earn daily profits
7. **Invite Friends**: Share your referral link to build your team and unlock higher levels

### For Developers

This is a frontend-only demo application that uses localStorage for data persistence. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace localStorage calls with API endpoints
2. Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
3. Add blockchain transaction verification
4. Set up database for user data and transactions
5. Implement email verification system
6. Add 2FA security features

## üí∞ How It Works

### Daily Clicking System
- Users can click a button 3-7 times per day (based on level)
- Each click generates 5-10% profit on their balance
- Earnings compound automatically
- Clicks reset daily at midnight

### Referral System
- Each user gets a unique referral code
- When someone registers with your code, they become your referral
- You earn 3-5% commission on their activities
- Invite 5 people ‚Üí Level 2 (5 clicks/day, higher rates)
- Invite 10 people ‚Üí Level 3 (7 clicks/day, maximum rates)

### Deposits & Withdrawals
- **Minimum Deposit**: 75‚Ç¨ (~75 USDT)
- **Supported Crypto**: USDT (TRC20), Bitcoin, Ethereum
- **Withdrawal Time**: 1-24 hours
- **Network Fee**: Paid by sender (deposits) or deducted (withdrawals)

## üîí Security Features

- Secure crypto wallet integration
- Transaction history tracking
- Email verification (to be implemented)
- 2FA support (to be implemented)
- All transactions on blockchain

## üì± Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers (optimized for 1200px+)
- Tablets (768px - 1024px)
- Mobile phones (320px - 767px)

## üé® Customization

### Changing Wallet Addresses

Edit the wallet addresses in `deposit.js`:

```javascript
const walletAddresses = {
    'usdt': 'YOUR_USDT_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'btc': 'YOUR_BTC_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'eth': 'YOUR_ETH_WALLET_ADDRESS'
};
```

### Changing Earning Rates

Edit the click logic in `dashboard.js`:

```javascript
const minPercent = 5 + (userData.level - 1);
const maxPercent = 8 + (userData.level - 1) * 2;
```

### Changing Level Requirements

Edit the level calculation in `dashboard.js`:

```javascript
function calculateLevel() {
    if (userData.referrals >= 10) {
        userData.level = 3;
        userData.maxClicks = 7;
        userData.bonusPercentage = 10;
    } else if (userData.referrals >= 5) {
        userData.level = 2;
        userData.maxClicks = 5;
        userData.bonusPercentage = 8;
    } else {
        userData.level = 1;
        userData.maxClicks = 3;
        userData.bonusPercentage = 5;
    }
}
```
